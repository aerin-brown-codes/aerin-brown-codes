### Hi there! 👋

- 🎓 I'm currently attending McGill University as a Software Engineering student with a Schulich Leader Scholarship. I have a 3.96/4.0 CGPA and am on the Dean's List.
- 🔭 I'm Software Lead of the McGill Robotics Mars rover project! My recent work has focused primarily on developing a robust autonomous navigation system and inverse kinematics-based arm controls.
- 💼 I worked at Employment and Social Development Canada as a Data Engineering Student in summer 2025, helping to develop a Python library to manage and transform hundreds of tables using the Azure Suite. I also worked at Tolko Industries in the summer of 2024 as an IT Student, helping to integrate Dynamics 365 F&O into 20+ applications with a team of 6.
- 📌 I'm a 2023 MLH Fellow in the Site Reliability Engineering track.
- 💙 I've got a particular interest in artificial intelligence and robotics, but I'm still exploring and eager to try as many areas of software development as I can.
- 🔎 I'm looking for a job, co-op, or paid internship in software engineering for summer 2026!
